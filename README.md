# Welcome to the 2021 DAO Global Hackathon!

**Our Goal for This Hackathon:** We are looking to further the world of DAO Tooling and open up the Aragon Stack to all communities.

## Aragon Bounties Are Focused On
**Integrations and furthering DAO Tooling**

This is an event focused on **DAO tooling**. It's also a highly collaborative event, and you'll see that we've co-sponsored several bounties with other teams.

Superfluid provides new ways to reward DAO community members, and to encourage their participation. If you're a builder joining this event, we want to help you build things that enable better coordination mechanisms & payment options for DAOs.

## This Hackathon is a 2 part event:
- 3 Weeks for Bounties - due by Nov 12th
- 1 month for open hacking - from Nov 12th to mid Dec.

Bounty prizes are determined by the Aragon team and co-sponsors.

The latter month of hacking (also called the 'Open Lanes' portion of the hackathon) is determined by a group of judges chosen by the event organizers. Our goal is to encourage hackers to successfully complete our bounties, and to provide technical support and encouragement to teams that want to build larger projects during the second part of the hackathon.

Please reach out to Alex@aragon.org with any questions. Happy hacking! ðŸš€
